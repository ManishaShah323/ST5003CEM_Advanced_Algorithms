## Introduction

This repository contains the complete coursework solutions for the module  
**ST5003CEM – Advanced Algorithms**, offered by Softwarica College of IT & E-Commerce
in collaboration with Coventry University.

The aim of this coursework is to demonstrate the ability to **understand, design,
implement, and analyze advanced algorithms** and apply them to both **theoretical
and real-world inspired problems**.

All solutions are implemented in **Python 3** and strictly follow the problem
requirements provided in the official assignment brief.



## Key Concepts Covered

The coursework includes implementations of the following algorithmic concepts:

- Geometric Optimization (Geometric Median using Weiszfeld’s Algorithm)
- Metaheuristic Algorithms (Simulated Annealing for TSP)
- Dynamic Programming (Optimization and decision problems)
- Greedy Algorithms
- Binary Trees and DFS-based optimization
- Graph Search Algorithms (DFS, BFS, A*)
- Multithreading and concurrency
- GUI-based algorithm simulation and visualization
