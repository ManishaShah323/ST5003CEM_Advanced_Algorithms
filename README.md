## Introduction

This repository contains the complete coursework solutions for the module  
ST5003CEM – Advanced Algorithms, offered by Softwarica College of IT & E-Commerce  
in collaboration with Coventry University.

The aim of this coursework is to demonstrate the ability to understand, design,
implement, and analyze advanced algorithms, and to apply them to both
theoretical and real-world inspired problems.

All solutions are implemented in Python 3 and strictly follow the problem
requirements provided in the official assignment brief.


## Key Concepts Covered

The coursework includes implementations of the following algorithmic concepts:

- Geometric Optimization
  - Geometric Median using Weiszfeld’s Algorithm

- Metaheuristic Algorithms
  - Simulated Annealing for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)

- Dynamic Programming
  - Optimization and decision-making problems

- Greedy Algorithms

- Tree-Based Algorithms
  - Binary Trees and DFS-based optimization

- Graph Search Algorithms
  - DFS, BFS, and A* algorithms

- Multithreading and Concurrency

- Algorithm Simulation
  - Included where explicitly required by the coursework brief

Repository Structure

Each Python file in this repository corresponds directly to a specific coursework
question, ensuring clear traceability between assignment tasks and implementations.


## Declaration
